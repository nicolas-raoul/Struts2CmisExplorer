Struts2CmisExplorer is a web-based CMIS explorer. It uses Struts2 for the user interface.

If you have documents stored in your ECM repository and want to expose them (or some of them) to your clients/employees through an Intranet (or Internet/portal) web application, Struts2CmisExplorer is for you:
- Open Source
- Easy to integrate into an existing portal
- No dependencies on a particular IoC framework, you can use your own

Struts2CmisExplorer works with any CMIS-compliant ECM (Enterprise Content Management) software. CMIS is a standard created by Alfresco, Day Software, EMC, FatWire, IBM, Microsoft, Open Text, Oracle, SAP and others.
