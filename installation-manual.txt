Struts2CmisExplorer
Installation Manual


=== I. Installation Procedure ===

1) Install "Eclipse for JEE developers". The classic version of Eclipse will not work.

2) Download Struts2CmisExplorer, and uncompress it if it is a compressed file.

3) Open Eclipse, click "File > Import > General > Existing Projects into Workspace", select the folder where you uncompressed the project, and finish importing the project.

4) On Eclipse's left pane (Project Explorer), check that a new project called "Struts2CmisExplorer" has appeared.

5) In the Struts2CmisExplorer project, open "src > jp.aegif.struts2cmisexplorer.opencmisbinding > OpenCMISRepositoryClientFacade.java

6) In this Java file, set the value of CMIS_ATOMPUB_URL, replacing it with the URL to your CMIS server.

7) In the left pane, right-click on the "Struts2CmisExplorer" project and select "Run as > Run on server".

8) Tomcat should have started with the Struts2CmisExplorer web application.

9) Access the web application at http://localhost:8080/Struts2CmisExplorer


=== II. Notes ===

1) For deployment outside of Eclipse, a WAR file is necessary. In the left pane, right-click on the "Struts2CmisExplorer" project and select "Export > WAR file". This WAR file can then be deployed in the "webapps" directory of a Tomcat 6 installation.

2) The number of results shown in a single page (pagination) can be configured by modifying MAX_ITEMS_PER_PAGE in OpenCMISRepositoryClientFacade.java
